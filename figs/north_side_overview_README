mainly based on north_face_from_old_devils_slide_trail.jpg
also used another photo from top of devil's slide for left side
shadows simulate lighting from left
not really a possible view of the rock, flattens the curved face
footprint is meant to enhance visual impression of 3-d, sort of coincides with tree line,
         but not super accurate
not sure about exact location of lunch rock, doesn't appear on photo
