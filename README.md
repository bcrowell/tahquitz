Climbing topos for Tahquitz
===========================

These are done topos in the traditional line-diagram style for climbs
at Tahquitz. In most cases I've done the climb several times, tried
different variations, etc., but there is no guarantee that my
information is correct. If you find mistakes or have suggestions for
improvements, please contact me using the contact info at
http://www.lightandmatter.com/area4author.html , or post a comment on
mountainproject.

The topos can be downloaded as a single multi-page PDF file, tahquitz.pdf, above. I
have also posted single pages for the individual climbs as images
on mountainproject, but those may become outdated as I make improvements.

I have a separate repository for photos and photo topos:
