Climbing topos for Tahquitz
===========================

These topos are for climbs at Tahquitz. In most
cases I've done the several times, tried different variations, etc., but there is
no guarantee that my information is correct. If you find mistakes or have
suggestions for improvements, please contact me using the contact info at
http://www.lightandmatter.com/area4author.html .

The climbs can be downloaded as a single PDF file, tahquitz.pdf, above. I
have also posted single single pages for the individual climbs as images
on mountainproject, but those may become outdated as I make improvements.
